Statistical Analysis Results

Performance Comparison:
E7-G4O-ELFT significantly outperformed B4-G4O with an F1 score of 83.18% compared to 80.14%, a difference of 3.04 percentage points.

Statistical Significance:
This difference was statistically significant according to both McNemar's test (p < 0.001) and bootstrap analysis (p < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for the difference was [2.15%, 3.96%].

Stability Analysis:
The results were assessed across multiple bootstrap runs (n=10000), with 
confidence interval bounds showing minimal variation (SD: 0.000045 to 
0.000085).

Methodological Details:
Statistical significance was assessed using McNemar's test for paired nominal data 
and a bootstrap analysis with 10000 iterations. The stability of the results 
was verified through multiple runs with different random seeds to ensure 
reproducibility of the findings.
