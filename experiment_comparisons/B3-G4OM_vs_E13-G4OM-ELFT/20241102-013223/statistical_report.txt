Statistical Analysis Results

Performance Comparison:
E13-G4OM-ELFT significantly outperformed B3-G4OM with an F1 score of 83.49% compared to 79.52%, a difference of 3.97 percentage points.

Statistical Significance:
This difference was statistically significant according to both McNemar's test (p < 0.001) and bootstrap analysis (p < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for the difference was [3.06%, 4.89%].

Stability Analysis:
The results were assessed across multiple bootstrap runs (n=10000), with 
confidence interval bounds showing minimal variation (SD: 0.000066 to 
0.000127).

Methodological Details:
Statistical significance was assessed using McNemar's test for paired nominal data 
and a bootstrap analysis with 10000 iterations. The stability of the results 
was verified through multiple runs with different random seeds to ensure 
reproducibility of the findings.
