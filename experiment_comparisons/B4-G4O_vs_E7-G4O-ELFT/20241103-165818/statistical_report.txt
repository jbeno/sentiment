Statistical Analysis Results

Performance Comparison:
E7-G4O-ELFT significantly outperformed B4-G4O with an F1 score of 81.57% compared to 80.14%, a difference of 1.44 percentage points.

Statistical Significance:
This difference was statistically significant according to both McNemar's test (p = 0.011) and bootstrap analysis (p = 0.003). The 95% confidence interval for the difference was [0.51%, 2.38%].

Stability Analysis:
The results were assessed across multiple bootstrap runs (n=10000), with 
confidence interval bounds showing minimal variation (SD: 0.000027 to 
0.000036).

Methodological Details:
Statistical significance was assessed using McNemar's test for paired nominal data 
and a bootstrap analysis with 10000 iterations. The stability of the results 
was verified through multiple runs with different random seeds to ensure 
reproducibility of the findings.
